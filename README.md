# Task Manager

Task Manager is a simple task management system built with **PostgreSQL** and **Fastify**. It provides basic task management functionalities, including user authentication and the ability to create, edit, and delete labels, statuses, and tasks. Tasks can also be sorted based on various criteria.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to be straightforward and accessible. It allows users to:

- Register and log in.
- Create, edit, and delete **labels**, **statuses**, and **tasks**.
- Sort tasks based on different attributes.
- View and manage tasks created by any user.

### Open Access Policy

In this project, all users have full access to all functionalities. This means that any user can:

- Create, update, and delete **any** task, label, or status.
- Edit and delete other users' tasks.

This design makes it an open-access system where all data is shared among users.

## Setting Up Environment Variables

The project uses environment variables stored in `.env` files.  
For running tests, create a `.env.test` file by copying `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.test
```

Then update the values in `.env.test` if necessary.

# Project Setup Locally

This project uses a `Makefile` to simplify common development tasks. Below are the steps for installation, development, and building the project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with npm)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

## Installation

To install project dependencies, run:

```bash
make install
```

This will install dependencies for both backend and frontend.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build the Project

To build the frontend for production:

```bash
make build
```

To start the built app:

```bash
make start
```

By default:

- Frontend is available at: [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)
- Backend API runs at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Run in development mode

```bash
make dev
```
